## Self-hosting
In order to host this bot on your own server, download the following:
- cogs (the folder)
- main.py
- new_bot.py

You should place all of the files you downloaded into a single folder.

Then:
- Create a text file called ".env" and insert your bot token there in the form of "TOKEN=bot_token_here"
- Create a folder called data (this is where the database will go).
- Run new_bot.py to generate the starting database.
- Run main.py to run the bot.

You should end up with a structure that looks like this:
